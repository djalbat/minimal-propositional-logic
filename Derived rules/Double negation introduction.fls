Rule (DoubleNegationIntroduction)
  Premise
    P
  Conclusion
    ¬¬P
  Proof
    Suppose
      ¬P
    Hence
      P
    Therefore
      P /\ ¬P by ConjunctionIntroduction
    ¬P => (P /\ ¬P) by ImplicationIntroduction
    ¬P => P by ConjunctionLeftEliminationWithImplication
    ¬P => ¬P by ConjunctionRightEliminationWithImplication
  Therefore
    ¬¬P by NegationIntroduction
