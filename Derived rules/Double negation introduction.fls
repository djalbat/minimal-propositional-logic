Rule (DoubleNegationIntroduction)
  Premise
    P
  Conclusion
    ¬¬P
  Proof
    Suppose
      ¬P
    Hence
      P
    Then
      P ∧ ¬P by ConjunctionIntroduction
    ¬P ⇒ (P ∧ ¬P) by ImplicationIntroduction
    ¬P ⇒ P by ConjunctionRightEliminationWithImplication
    ¬P ⇒ ¬P by ConjunctionLeftEliminationWithImplication
  Therefore
    ¬¬P by NegationIntroduction
