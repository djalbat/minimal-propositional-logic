Rule (ConstructiveDilemma)
  Premises
    P => R
    Q => S
    P \/ Q
  Conclusion
    R \/ S
  Proof
    Suppose
      P
    Hence
      P => R
      R by ModusPonens
    Then
      R \/ S by DisjunctionRightIntroduction
    P => (R \/ S) by ImplicationIntroduction
    Suppose
      Q
    Hence
      Q => S
      S by ModusPonens
    Then
      R \/ S by DisjunctionLeftIntroduction
    Q => (R \/ S) by ImplicationIntroduction
  Therefore
    R \/ S by DisjunctionElimination
